# ASPNET-Week-3

Changed file structure to a Feature-Folder Architecture (/Features/Products)

Moved DuplicateService to the Products folder because it is closely related to the product controller

Added attribute routing to both the Home and Product Controller. Inside the app builder, I changed the MapControllerRoute() method to the MapControllers() method.

I wanted to move the Product View into the Features folder but ran into errors with the model that I have no idea on how to fix.
